Then the data has been split into train and test sets.The data has been scaled and PCA has been used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
GridSearchCV has been used to find the best parameters for the machine learning models.Different machine learning models are used on the train and test data and their scores are recorded to select the models with the best performance.
